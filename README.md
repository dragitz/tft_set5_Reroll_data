# tft_set5_Reroll_data
Rerolling data extracted from TFT

I made a bot that rerolled 1000 times.

Reroll amount: 1000

Player level: 4

Champions in bank: Kha'Zix (lvl. 3) - Soraka (lvl. 3) - Kled (lvl 3) - Gragas (lvl 3)

Since I already have champions, the data is biased, but I did that on purpose.

# -

The file array.txt contain the obtained champions in order. So every 4 lines is a reroll.

Data has also been obtained via tutorial, so percentages might be different from online. (you figure out if data is close enought)

# -

I made this for a personal project, if you need to collect data yourself, don't hesitate to contact me. 
You can do it by creating an issue (so I get notified) and I will give you my discord id and will provide you with the python code used to gather the data.
